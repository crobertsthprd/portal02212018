<strong>CCV Number Explained</strong><br>(Credit Card Verification or Card Code Verification Number)<BR><BR>

This CCV is found in different places depending on what type of credit card that you have. This fraud protection system has been created so that if someone does have possession of your credit card number they also need to have physical possession of your card in order to know what your CCV is. The district also benefits from a lower processing fee for cards that have the CCV included.<BR><BR>
